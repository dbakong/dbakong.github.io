If you're reading this, you've stumbled upon my corner of the internet. This blog is a place for me to share my thoughts and experiences on a variety of topics, from cutting-edge software engineering to my latest outdoor adventures.

## Interests

By day, I'm an SRE at a startup in the Bay Area, where I spend my time building and scaling reliable, fault-tolerant infrastructure. But when I'm not at work, you can find me exploring the great outdoors or diving deep into my latest passion: deep learning.

I've set out on a mission to complete the [Deep Learning Curriculum](https://github.com/jacobhilton/deep_learning_curriculum#how-to-use-this-curriculum), which will take me through the fundamentals of machine learning all the way to advanced topics like natural language processing and computer vision. To get there, I'll be brushing up on my prerequisites with courses like [Fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/) Part 1&2 and [FSDL](https://fullstackdeeplearning.com/). It's a long road ahead, but I'm excited to be on it!

## Learning Plan

1. Prerequisites:
    - Fast.ai Part 1 & 2
    - FSDL
2. Core curriculum
    - Reading and implementing papers for each chapter

I hope you find something useful or entertaining here!
