## Wecome to Dbakong's Blog!

This is **bold** text, and this is *emphasized* text.

Visit the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) website!

Welcome to my blog! The purpose of this blog is to share my thoughts and experiences with the world - mostly about software engineering, but also about other topics that I find interesting. I hope you find something useful here!

### Interests
I am currently a an SRE at a bay area startup and I am intested in Deep learning, software infrastructure.

To advance my knowledge in these areas, I am currently working on completing [Deep Learning Curriculum](https://github.com/jacobhilton/)

## Learning plan:

1. Prerequisites:
    - [Fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/) Part 1& 2
    - [FSDL](https://fullstackdeeplearning.com/)
2. [Core](https://github.com/jacobhilton/deep_learning_curriculum#how-to-use-this-curriculum)

I don't know how long it'll take me to complete this, but I look forward to being hopefully a better engineer at the end of it.
